# react-employee-directory

React Employee Directory utilizes the component feature of React to create an employee directory. The user will be able to view the entire employee directory at once in a table form, allowing easy access to all non-sensistive information. The user is also able to sort the categories as well as filter by properties.

This application utilizes Reactâ€™s component UI but breaking each component up into a state as well as Random User API.
